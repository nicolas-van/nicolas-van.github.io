title: Loading Quest â€“ Javascript Loading Widget for RPG Lovers
---

[Loading Quest](https://nicolas-van.github.io/loadingquest) is a small Javascript library to display a role playing video game on web applications that have long processing requests.

Do you know [Progress Quest](http://progressquest.com/)? The fake RPG that plays by itself? The day I discovered it I always dreamed of a Javascript version to display in the web application of my company during the 10-minutes long database creation process. That would be much more fun than any spinning circle. So I created it.
